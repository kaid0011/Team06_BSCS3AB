        <hr>
        <p><strong>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</p></strong>
        By submitting your email address on our service, you agree to receive emails from us. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. <B>Note</B>: You can change the email used in your account anytime, but you cannot leave an account with no email as it is required for a number of verification steps.
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</p></strong>
        We are incorporated in Philippines. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the transborder transfer and hosting of such information.
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Is the information collected through our service secure?</p></strong>
        We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

        <p><strong>Can I update or correct my information?</p></strong>
        The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Pe"If you are a current user and has an account in Virtual Diary, you have the authority to personally update or delete your information and the account itself. However, the rights such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.

        <p><strong>How Long Do We keep Your Information?</p></strong>

This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.
